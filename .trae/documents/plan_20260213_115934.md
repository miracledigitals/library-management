The error `Error refreshing profile from database: {}` occurs because `refreshProfile` uses `.single()`, which throws an error if the user's profile record hasn't been created in the database yet (e.g., immediately after signup before the trigger finishes).

I will fix this by:
1.  **Modifying `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`**:
    *   Change `.single()` to `.maybeSingle()` in the `refreshProfile` function. This prevents the error when no row is found (it returns `null` instead of throwing).
    *   This aligns `refreshProfile` with the logic we already implemented in `handleUserChange`.

This change ensures that if the database profile is missing (temporarily or permanently), the app will silently handle it (keeping the existing state) rather than logging an error.
